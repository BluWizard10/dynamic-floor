# v0.2.0-beta
- Added Toggle for the Floor Collider, located in the Expressions Menu as `Blu's Add-ons/Floor Collider`.
- Removed the old `World` Object as a Source for the World Constraint, as it no longer needs a Source for the World Constraint to work as of SDK `3.6.2-constraints.2` version.

- VRC Constraint's `Freeze To World` function will now only lock the selected Axis under `Constraint Settings` instead as of SDK `3.6.2-constraints.2` version, eliminating the requirement for a `World` Object Source to control selected Axis.

- Bumped minimum version requirement of `VRChat SDK - Avatars` to `3.6.2-constraints.2`.
